                    C was my first programming language; and was my first programming<br>
                    class, taken at St. Louis Community Collage. My experience in this<br>
                    class was more or less learning to use basic input-output statements<br>
                    (printf(), scanf(), etc...) using the Unix environment, as will as<br>
                    if() statements, for() and while() loops, case{} statements, etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I gained most of my C++, and programming experience while taking<br>
                    computer science courses at the University of Missouri @ Rolla, now<br>
                    called the University of Science & Technology.

                <h3>Education:</h3>
                <p>
                    My first class at the University S&T was Operating Systems, which was<br>
                    a little too extensive for my weak background in C++ at the time. Thus<br>
                    my OS teacher put me in Data Structures the following semester. There is<br>
                    where I learned the concept of object oriented programming. I learned<br>
                    how to construct and implement classes, use objects, and other data<br>
                    structures.  I also learned how to use algorithms to solve problems (such<br>
                    as sorting, and searching),
